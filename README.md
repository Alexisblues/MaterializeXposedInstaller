Xposed Module to convert Xposed Installer App UI to Material UI

Developer Note : I made this Module in 10 Minutes so that I can enjoy Material UI inside the Xposed Installer App.
For now it's very basic and provides 3 different themes to choose from.
Feel free to fork and upgrade it if you have anything new in mind.
But, please do not release a new separate version.
Instead, update me regarding your changes and I will try my best to add those in my source and release an update.
You may compile a different version for your personal use.
